## Overview

The OSINT Tool is a modular and extensible openâ€‘source intelligence gathering platform that combines both passive and active scanning capabilities. It is designed to automatically analyze provided inputs, dynamically discover additional targets, and correlate findings through a unified knowledge graph.

## Capabilities

### Passive Intelligence Gathering

- **Email Module:**  
  Retrieves reputation and breach data for email addresses and extracts associated details such as domain and local part.
- **Username Module:**  
  Searches for user profiles across public platforms (e.g., GitHub, Reddit) and generates username variants.
- **Domain Module:**  
  Conducts WHOIS lookups, DNS queries, and scrapes website content for additional intelligence.
- **IP Module:**  
  Retrieves detailed IP information, including ASN data and network characteristics.
- **Phone Module:**  
  Validates phone numbers and gathers related information using robust parsing libraries.
- **Address Module:**  
  Geocodes street addresses via the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API to obtain geographic details.
- **Real Name Module:**  
  Searches for public records and relevant information (e.g., from Wikipedia) associated with real names.

### Active Scanning Capabilities

- **Nmap Tool:**  
  Performs active port scanning and service detection.
- **Gobuster Tool:**  
  Enumerates directories and files on web servers.
- **Nikto Tool:**  
  Scans web servers for known vulnerabilities.
- **Hydra Tool:**  
  Executes brute-force attacks against network services (active use requires explicit authorization).
- **Medeusa Tool:**  
  Tests web applications for potential vulnerabilities (active use requires explicit authorization).

### Dynamic Discovery and Correlation

- **Automatic Expansion:**  
  The tool dynamically discovers additional targets during a scan (e.g., discovering a phone number associated with an email) and automatically initiates further searches.
- **Knowledge Graph:**  
  All discovered entities and their relationships are aggregated into a NetworkX-based graph for comprehensive correlation and visualization.

### User Interfaces

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  
  Run scans directly via the terminal.
- **Web User Interface (Web UI):**  
  A modern, responsive interface built with Flask and Bootstrap. It includes interactive visualizations powered by PyVis, as well as dedicated pages for configuring settings and viewing detailed logs.

### Modular Architecture

- **Independent Configuration:**  
  Each module (passive and active) is individually configurable through JSON files stored in the `configs/` folder.
- **Extensibility:**  
  The modular design makes it easy to add or update scanning modules and active tools without disrupting the core functionality.
